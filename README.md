__Program used for detecting mecciRNAs from RNA-seq data and explicating pains but poor gains.__

# Motivation  
  - In October 2019, someone asked me for help about identifying mecciRNAs from RNA-seq data. From then on, by putting a lot effort into this work, I accomplished this program at December 2020.
{% warning %}
# {% __ CRITICAL ALARM __%}

  - **1.** This pipeline has __neither been benchmarked__ against any existing software __nor systematically__ tested on enough sequencing data, so its correctness __CANNOT__ be guaranteed.  

  - **2.** This program was extensively used throughout a study leaded by the person mentioned in the above __Motivation__. Given that I was not a co-first author of this study, I have been thinking that I am under **NO obligation** to take responsibility for __ANY__ possible consequence caused by this program, including but not limited to **error** of this program itself, **false positive** or **false negative**.  

  - **3.** Please __DO NOT__ contact me for ANY issue about this program. This hold true for all. 

  - **4.** __NO ONE ELSE__ is authorized to use, copy, modify, or distribute the project without my permission. A violation of this provision means infringement immediately.

# Future plan

## Currently, I assert that there's no plan to benchmark or improve this program in the future.
