__Program used for detecting mecciRNAs from RNA-seq data.__
# __!!!!__ CRITICAL ALARM!!

## __!!!!__ This pipeline has neither been benchmarked against any existing software nor systematically tested on enough sequencing data, so its correctness cannot be guaranteed.  

## __!!!!__ Given that I was neither a co-first author nor even the second author of a study for which this program was developed by putting a lot of my effort into, I am under **NO obligation** to take responsibility for any possible outcome caused by this program, including but not limited to **ERROR** of this program itself, **false positive** and **false negative**.  

## __!!!!__ Please __DO NOT__ contact me for ANY issue about this program.  

## __!!!!__ No one else is authorized to use, copy, modify, or distribute the project.
