__Program used for detecting mecciRNAs from RNA-seq data.__
# CRITICAL ALARM!!
This pipeline has neither been benchmarked against any existing software nor systematically tested on enough sequencing data, so its correctness cannot be guaranteed.  

__!!!!__ I am under **NO obligation** to take responsibility for any possible outcome caused by this program, including but not limited to **ERROR** of this program itself, **false positive** and **false negative**.

Please __DO NOT__ contact me given that I was neither a co-first author nor even the second author of a study for which this program was developed by putting a lot of my effort into.
