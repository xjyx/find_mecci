__Program used for detecting mecciRNAs from RNA-seq data and explicating pains but poor gains.__

# __!!!!__ CRITICAL ALARM !!!!

  - **1.** This pipeline has __neither been benchmarked__ against any existing software __nor systematically__ tested on enough sequencing data, so its correctness __CANNOT__ be guaranteed.  

  - **2.**  Given that I was __not__ a co-first author of a study for which this program was developed by putting a lot of my effort into, I am under **NO obligation** to take responsibility for __ANY__ possible consequence caused by this program, including but not limited to **error** of this program itself, **false positive** or **false negative**.  

  - **3.** Please __DO NOT__ contact me for ANY issue about this program.  

  - **4.** __NO ONE ELSE__ is authorized to use, copy, modify, or distribute the project without my permission. A violation of this provision means infringement.
